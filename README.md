- Add your DB connection string into the AppSettings file.
- run the command 'add-migration "Initial-Migration"' in Package Manager Console
- run the next command 'update-database' in the package manager console
- Run the app

- The data seeding may not work, It is patchy, if it doesn't go to register.cshtml.cs and change the addrole to "Admin", then create an account then to "Staff" and create an account then to "Member" and create an account then you can see the permissions of each role.

Thanks for downloading this project and viewing it. Have fun happy hacking ;)
